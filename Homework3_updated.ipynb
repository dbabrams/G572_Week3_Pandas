        "The Conceptual Hydrogeologic Model for the Green River Lowlands is that the upper aquifer (the Tampico) is separated from the lower aquifer (the Sankoty) by a clay aquitard. In this problem, you are going to estimate the vertical leakage across this aquitard at one of the ISWS monitoring wells- Lee 91. For your reference, Lee 91B is open to only the Tampico and Lee 91A is open to only the Sankoty. \n",
